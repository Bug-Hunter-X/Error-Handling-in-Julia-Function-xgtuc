# Julia Error Handling Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia code and how to improve error handling.

The `bug.jl` file contains a function that throws an error when given a negative input.  The `bugSolution.jl` file shows an improved version with better error handling.

This example showcases a basic but effective error handling strategy that prevents program crashes and provides informative messages.
